Who can still win the drivers WDC?
======================================

Calculates which drivers still has chance to win the WDC.
Simplified since it doesn't compare positions if points are equal.

This example implements 3 functions that it then uses to calculate
its result.

Get the current driver standings from Ergast.

We need a function to calculates the maximum amount of points possible if a
driver wins everything left of the season.

For each driver we will see if there is a chance to get more points than
the current leader. We assume the leader gets no more points and the
driver gets the theoretical maximum amount of points.

We currently don't consider the case of two drivers getting equal points
since its more complicated and would require comparing positions.

    def calculate_who_can_win(driver_standings, max_points):
        LEADER_POINTS = int(driver_standings.loc[0]['points'])

        for i, _ in enumerate(driver_standings.iterrows()):
            driver = driver_standings.loc[i]
            driver_max_points = int(driver["points"]) + max_points
            can_win = 'No' if driver_max_points < LEADER_POINTS else 'Yes'

            print(f"{driver['position']}: {driver['givenName'] + ' ' + driver['familyName']}, "
                  f"Current points: {driver['points']}, "

Now using the 3 functions above we can use them to calculate who
can still win.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 69-78

.. code-block:: Python


    # Get the current drivers standings
    driver_standings = get_drivers_standings()

    # Get the maximum amount of points
    points = calculate_max_points_for_remaining_season()

    # Print which drivers can still win
    calculate_who_can_win(driver_standings, points)
