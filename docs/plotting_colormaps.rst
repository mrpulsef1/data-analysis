Colormaps
---------

Below the colormaps for team colors over all supported seasons are shown.

The ``'official'`` colormap contains the colors exactly as they are used by
the FOM in official graphics and in the TV graphics. Those colors are often
slightly muted. While that makes them more pleasing to look at in some graphics,
it also reduces the contrast between colors which is often bad for
readability of plots.

The ``'default'`` colormap is FastF1's default colormap. These colors are teams
primary colors or accent colors as they are used by the teams on their website
or in promotional material. The colors are chosen to maximize readability in
plots by creating a stronger contrast while still being associated with the
team.
