What's new in v3.2.0
--------------------

(released dd/mm/2023)


Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Fix incorrect lap number (zero instead of one) for generated laps that are
  added when a driver crashes on the very first lap.

- Fix broken schedule backend 'f1timing' (failed to load 2023 season schedule
  after Qatar GP due to unexpected data)

- Fix: failing lap accuracy check for one driver caused laps of all drivers to
  be marked as inaccurate (#464)


New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Methods :meth:`fastf1.core.Lap.get_telemetry` and
  :meth:`fastf1.core.Laps.get_telemetry` now take an additional ``frequency``
  keyword argument to override the default frequency that is used for
  resampling.
